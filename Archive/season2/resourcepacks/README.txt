None of these resource packs are ACTUALLY required, only highly highly reccomended. Feel free to add any of your own


To install, copy the files out of this folder and put all of them into your resourcepacks folder in appdata/.minecraft .
Then, start the server, open options, and click Resource Packs. Press the arrows to bring them all into the right side if they are not already.
Finally, Enjoy!
